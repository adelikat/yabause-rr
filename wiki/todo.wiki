===High===

  * Implement desmume hotkey checking system without freezing gui
  * The screenshot display when loading a state is broken for gtk pure software, opengl doesn't display correctly due to glzoompixels or whatever.  It needs to save the vidsoft framebuffer for software mode I guess.
  * When resuming, any pressed keys will get stuck and record into the movie.
  * Gamepad input will randomly stop working, requiring you to enter the input menu to get it restarted
  * The ram search window doesn't display properly the second time you open it in a session
          adelikat: Are you sure this is still valid?  It doesn't happen for me.
  * Compilation is broken on other platforms
  * Clean up the savestates / anything else now that the old movie system is gone
  * Resolve these random crash problems
