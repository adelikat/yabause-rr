  * Snes9x Hotkeys
       * Implement desmume hotkey checking system without freezing gui
       * Make background input optional - this is not actually a problem, just that frame advance hack for myself

  * The main cvs crashes when open cue iso is used - what is the difference?
  * Toggle OSD menu item
  * Avi code causes buffer overflows with SCSP_FRAMEACCURATE defined
  * Resuming can break, resulting in an "inverted" movie. Mnemonics are placed for non-pressed and . are placed for pressed.
  * Remove the leftover junk from the old movie format
  * The screenshot display when loading a state is broken for gtk pure software, opengl doesn't display correctly due to glzoompixels or whatever.  It needs to save the vidsoft framebuffer for software mode I guess.
  * Hotkey ini saving broke?
  * When resuming, any pressed keys will get stuck and record into the movie.
  * The ram search window doesn't display properly the second time you open it in a session
