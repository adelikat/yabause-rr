1 Introduction________________________________________________

This file documents the Dreamcast version only, for general
information check the README file. Note, that if you are just
a casual user, and not a developer, you probably won't have
to worry about the Compiling instructions below. Pick up with
the section "How to use Yabause" to learn how to make a CD
image you can burn to use Yabause (or use a program like
Selfboot).


2 Compiling instructions______________________________________

Yabause is written in C using KallistiOS. So, in order to
compile it, you need a working sh-elf targetted C compiler, 
such as gcc and a working KallistiOS environment:

  * http://gamedev.allusion.net

Once KallistiOS is set up, you should be ready to build 
Yabause.

Uncompress the Yabause source archive, move to the newly
created directory, type "cd src", then "make -f Makefile.dc",
it will generate one binary: "yabause.bin" in the "src"
directory.


3 How to use Yabause__________________________________________

Before using Yabause, you need to build a CD with a few files
in the correct places. In order to build a CD with the
compiled binary, you must first scramble the binary. This can
be done with the scramble utility which can be obtained from
http://mc.pp.se/dc/files/scramble.c . This will have to be
compiled with your native compiler. Once you run the scramble
program on the yabause.bin file created in section 2 above,
you will have a binary file suitable for booting on a real
Dreamcast.

Once you have your scrambled binary, you may choose to include
a Sega Saturn BIOS image on your disc as well. As of 0.9.5,
this is not a requirement for the Dreamcast port, but if you
choose to use an actual BIOS image, it must be put on the
root of the CD and named "saturn.bin".

From this point, follow your favorite guide for how to build
a selfbooting CD out of plain files. I use the one available
at http://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html .


4 Final Thoughts______________________________________________

The Dreamcast port of Yabause is quite slow. I have done very
little in the way of optimizing any of the core of Yabause
toward the Dreamcast (there is quite a bit that could be done
when time allows). Do not expect the Dreamcast port of
Yabause to run your favorite Sega Saturn games at any sort of
playable speed for now (or the near future). As Yabause
matures, and I have more time to work on it, hopefully speed
will improve. For now, think of it as a fancy tech demo.

Note that in 0.9.5, a small bit of assembly has appeared in
the Dreamcast port. Hopefully as time goes on more of the
Dreamcast specific code will be rewritten in assembly for at
least some small speed increase.
