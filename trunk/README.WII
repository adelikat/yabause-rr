1 Special Notice______________________________________________

Please note that the Wii port is in alpha status, and won't be
officially supported until a later date. If you would like to
contribute, please contact us(see the contact information
section in README).

2 Compiling instructions______________________________________

Yabause is written in C using the devkitPro packages. You can
download it from:

http://www.devkitpro.org

Once this is installed, you should be ready to install Yabause.

To compile, either use the Makefile.wii file in the src
subdirectory to compile it(e.g. make -f Makefile.wii) or you can
use configure in the main directory as follows:

./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=powerpc-gekko

Once that's done, type "make". It should now take some time to
compile so go grab yourself a sandwich or beer - whatever suits
your fancy and it should be done in a few minutes. You should
now have a file called "yabause.elf". Now all you have to do is
load it on your Wii(which is something we won't cover here).


3 How to use Yabause__________________________________________
