1 Compiling instructions______________________________________

Yabause is written in C using the OpenGL library, so you need a working C compiler(such as gcc) and
these libraries, runtime and development packages:

  * OpenGL should be included with your compiler, if it isn't,
    check on your compiler's website for links.

Yabause can also use the SDL library:

  * http://www.libsdl.org/

Yabause can also use the GLUT library:

  * Check google, I haven't been able to find a good
    source for it.

Once these libraries installed, you should be ready to
install Yabause.

Building the Qt 4 port require the Qt 4.3.x libraries too, it's a crossplatform C++ library for various all days crossplatform work ( gui, threads ... ).
I used the version 4.3.4 version for the developement and tests, so please don't report bugs if you are not using at least this version.

Compiling for Windows : using mingw/cygwin__________________________________

All you have to do now is now is go into your mingw/cygwin
shell environment, go into the directory where you extracted
yabause, and type: "./configure --enable-newperinterface ---with-port=qt". Once that's done(and there
was no errors), type: "make". It should now take some time to
compile so go grab yourself a sandwich or beer - whatever suits
your fancy and it should be done in a few minutes. Now all you
have to do is type "./src/qt/release/yabause" in order to run it.

Compiling for Mac OS X : using gcc__________________________________________

Uncompress the Yabause source archive, move to the newly
created directory, type "./configure --enable-newperinterface --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-shared --with-port=qt", then "make",
it will generate a bundle: "Yabause.app" in the "src/qt"
directory.
You can then use Yabause by opening the bundle with:
"open Yabause.app" or with the Mac OS X finder.

Compiling for *Nix/Linux/BSD ? : using gcc__________________________________

Uncompress the Yabause source archive, move to the newly
created directory, type "./configure --enable-newperinterface ---with-port=qt", then "make",
it will generate one program: "yabause" in the "src/qt"
directory.


You can also pass the --enable-debug option to the configure script, Yabause
will then print debug messages in a special dock window.
(Use the --help flag for a complete list of options.)

You can even type "make install" to install that program on
your system (in /usr/local/ by default), then uninstalling is
done by typing "make uninstall".

You can try to read other specific README files for more informations.

2 How to use Yabause__________________________________________

Before using Yabause, you need to configure a few things in
the Preferences dialog (File>Settings).


2.1 Configuration_____________________________________________

First, set the BIOS path.
Yabause can run some games without a BIOS, but most of them
needs it. If you want to use the emulated BIOS, just let the
BIOS entry blank.

Next, set the cdrom device.
It can be a cd device, an iso or a cue file. Set the cd type
accordingly.

The last thing you have to configure is the keys.

Once eveything is set, you can start emulation with the
"Emulation>Run" entry.
