1 Introduction________________________________________________

This file documents the mac version only, for general
information check the README file.


2 Compiling instructions______________________________________

Yabause is written in C using the AGL, Carbon, IOKIit and
OpenGL libraries. Those librarires should be include with you
Mac OS X system.

Yabause can also use the SDL library:

  * http://www.libsdl.org/

Once these libraries are installed, you should be ready to
install Yabause.

Uncompress the Yabause source archive, move to the newly
created directory, type

    ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-shared

then

    make

it will generate one program: "yabause" in the "src/carbon"
directory and copy it in the Yabause.app bundle.

You can also pass the --enable-debug, --enable-vdp1-debug,
--enable-cd-debug options to the configure script, Yabause
will then print debug messages on the error standard output.
(Use the --help flag for a complete list of options.)

You can then use Yabause by opening the bundle with:
"open Yabause.app" or with the Mac OS X finder.


3 How to use Yabause__________________________________________

Before using Yabause, you need to configure a few things in
the Preferences dialog (Yabause>Preferences).


3.1 Configuration_____________________________________________

First, set the BIOS path.
Yabause can run some games without a BIOS, but most of them
needs it. If you want to use the emulated BIOS, just let the
BIOS entry blank.

Next, set the cdrom device.
It can be a cd device, an iso or a cue file. Set the cd type
accordingly.

The last thing you have to configure is the keys.

Once eveything is set, you can start emulation with the
"Yabause>run" entry.


3.2 Command line arguments____________________________________

-b (or --bios=)
    Specify bios file.
-c (or --cdrom=)
    Specify cd device. You can know which file is used as cd
    device by looking in /etc/fstab. It is commonly something
    like /dev/hdc or /dev/hdd for IDE devices and /dev/scd0
    for SCSI devices.
-i (or --iso=)
    Specify iso file.
